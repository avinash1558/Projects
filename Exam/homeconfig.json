In the state of Victoria, some state high schools are referred to as secondary colleges, although the pre-eminent government secondary school for boys in Melbourne is still named Melbourne High School. In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, 'college' is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and also some older ones. In New South Wales, some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as 'secondary colleges'. In Queensland some newer schools which accept primary and high school students are styled state college, but state schools offering only secondary education are called 'State High School'. In Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, 'college' refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, 'college' is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of matriculation college.",
