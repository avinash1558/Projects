              <p>
                Touch typing is a method of typing on a keyboard using all your
                fingers without looking at the keys. It is a skill that requires
                practice and dedication to master. Touch typing is considered to
                be more efficient than the hunt-and-peck method, which involves
                the typist looking at the keyboard and finding each individual
                key. The goal of touch typing is to increase speed, accuracy and
                comfort when typing.

              <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a type of computer technology
                that focuses on creating machines that can think, reason, act
                and react like a human. AI systems are designed to learn from
                their environment and take actions that are most likely to
                achieve their goals. Examples of AI include virtual personal
                assistants, facial recognition technology, self-driving cars,
                medical diagnosis systems, and video game playing robots.
